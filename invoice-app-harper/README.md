# invoice-app-harper

Your new app is now ready for development!

Here's what you should do next:

## Installation

To get started, make sure you have [installed Harper](https://docs.harperdb.io/docs/deployments/install-harper):

```sh
npm install -g harper
```

## Development

Then you can start your app:

```sh
npm run dev
```

TypeScript is supported at runtime in Node.js through [type stripping](https://nodejs.org/api/typescript.html#type-stripping). Full TypeScript language support can be enabled through integrating third party build steps to transpile your TypeScript into JavaScript.

### Define Your Schema

1. Create a new yourTableName.graphql file in the [schemas](./schemas) directory.
2. Craft your schema by hand.
3. Save your changes.

These schemas are the heart of a great Harper app, specifying which tables you want and what attributes/fields they should have. Any table you `@export` stands up [endpoints automatically](./.agents/skills/harper-best-practices/rules/automatic-apis.md).

### Add Custom Endpoints

1. Create a new greeting.ts file in the [resources](./resources) directory.

2. Customize your resource:

   ```typescript
   import { type RecordObject, type RequestTargetOrId, Resource } from "harper";

   interface GreetingRecord {
     greeting: string;
   }

   export class Greeting extends Resource<GreetingRecord> {
     static loadAsInstance = false;

     async post(
       target: RequestTargetOrId,
       newRecord: Partial<GreetingRecord & RecordObject>,
     ): Promise<GreetingRecord> {
       // By default, only super users can access these endpoints.
       return { greeting: "Greetings, post!" };
     }

     async get(target?: RequestTargetOrId): Promise<GreetingRecord> {
       // But if we want anyone to be able to access it, we can turn off the permission checks!
       target.checkPermission = false;
       return { greeting: "Greetings, get! " + process.version };
     }

     async put(
       target: RequestTargetOrId,
       record: GreetingRecord & RecordObject,
     ): Promise<GreetingRecord> {
       target.checkPermission = false;
       if (this.getCurrentUser()?.name?.includes("Coffee")) {
         // You can add your own authorization guards, of course.
         return new Response("Coffee? COFFEE?!", { status: 418 });
       }
       return { greeting: "Sssssssssssssss!" };
     }

     async patch(
       target: RequestTargetOrId,
       record: Partial<GreetingRecord & RecordObject>,
     ): Promise<GreetingRecord> {
       return { greeting: "We can make this work!" };
     }

     async delete(target: RequestTargetOrId): Promise<boolean> {
       return true;
     }
   }
   ```

3. Save your changes.

### View Your Website

Pop open [http://localhost:9926](http://localhost:9926) to view [index.html](./index.html) in your browser.

### Use Your API

Test your application works by querying the `/Greeting` endpoint:

```sh
curl http://localhost:9926/Greeting
```

You should see the following:

```json
{ "greeting": "Hello, world!" }
```

### Configure Your App

Take a look at the [default configuration](./config.yaml), which specifies how files are handled in your application.

## Deployment

Deploy your app to a Harper cluster **by reference**: instead of uploading a snapshot of your files, you tell Harper which commit of your GitHub repository to run, pinned by its exact commit SHA. Re-deploying the same commit is repeatable, and rolling back is just deploying an older commit.

First, head to [https://fabric.harper.fast/](https://fabric.harper.fast/), log in, and create a cluster. Then log your local CLI in to it:

```sh
harper login
```

### One-time setup (private repos)

So the cluster can clone your private repository, give it a read-only token — sealed on your machine, stored encrypted:

```sh
npm run deploy:setup
```

This fetches your cluster's public key, has you provide a GitHub token (a fine-grained PAT with **Contents: Read-only**, or your `gh` CLI session), **encrypts it locally**, and stores only the ciphertext in the cluster's secret store. The plaintext never leaves your machine; the cluster decrypts it in memory only while cloning. Because the token is durable, rollbacks keep working for as long as it's valid.

> Public repo? Skip this step and drop `credential=true` from the `deploy` script — no credential is needed.

### Deploy

```sh
npm run deploy
```

This deploys the current commit over `git+https` — commit and push first, since the cluster clones from GitHub and only sees pushed commits. To roll back, check out an older commit and run it again.

### Deploy automatically from CI

The included [GitHub Actions workflow](./.github/workflows/deploy.yaml) deploys whenever you push a version tag:

```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push --tags
```

Add these repository secrets first, under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

- `HARPER_CLI_TARGET` — your cluster's operations URL (e.g. `https://your-cluster.harperdb.io:9925`)
- `HARPER_CLI_REFRESH_TOKEN` — a long-lived token CI authenticates with, so no password is stored

Set both in one command — this pipes the credentials straight from your cluster into GitHub, so the token never appears on screen or in your shell history:

```sh
harper login --for-ci | gh secret set --env-file -
```

(No [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com)? `harper login --for-ci | pbcopy` copies the two lines for you to paste in by hand.)

The clone credential already lives in the cluster from `npm run deploy:setup`, so CI never handles a token itself.

### Private npm dependencies

If your app depends on private npm packages, run `npm run deploy:setup` again and choose the npm registry — the same sealed-token flow, stored as a separate credential.
