# Handling Binary Data

Instructions for the agent to follow when storing and serving binary data (images, audio, arbitrary content types) in Harper.

## When to Use

Apply this rule when a Harper resource needs to accept, store, or serve binary payloads such as images, audio files, or calendar data. Use it when REST clients send `base64`-encoded data inside JSON, when raw binary is uploaded via `PUT`/`POST`, or when a resource must stream binary back to the client with the correct `Content-Type`.

## How It Works

1. **Accept base64-encoded binary from JSON clients**: Decode the incoming `base64` string with `Buffer.from` and wrap it using `createBlob`, recording the MIME type. Override `post` in your resource class:

   ```typescript
   import { type RequestTargetOrId, tables, createBlob } from "harper";

   export class Photo extends tables.Photo {
     static async post(target: RequestTargetOrId, record: any) {
       if (record.data) {
         record.data = createBlob(
           Buffer.from(record.data, record.encoding || "base64"),
           {
             type: record.contentType || "application/octet-stream",
           },
         );
       }
       return super.post(target, record);
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Serve binary from a resource**: Override `get` to return a response object with the blob's MIME type in the `Content-Type` header and the blob as the body. Harper streams it to the client:

   ```typescript
   export class Photo extends tables.Photo {
     static async get(target: RequestTargetOrId) {
       const record = await super.get(target);
       if (record?.data) {
         return {
           status: 200,
           headers: {
             "Content-Type": record.data.type || "application/octet-stream",
           },
           body: record.data,
         };
       }
       return record;
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Upload raw binary with a non-standard content type**: Make a `PUT` or `POST` with any non-standard `Content-Type` header. Harper automatically stores the body as a record with `contentType` and `data` properties:

   ```http
   PUT /my-resource/33
   Content-Type: text/calendar

   BEGIN:VCALENDAR
   VERSION:2.0
   ...
   ```

   Harper stores this as:

   ```json
   {
     "contentType": "text/calendar",
     "data": "BEGIN:VCALENDAR\nVERSION:2.0\n..."
   }
   ```

   Retrieving that record returns the response with the stored `Content-Type` and body. If the content type is not from the `text` family, the data is treated as binary (a Node.js `Buffer`).

4. **Upload binary to a specific property**: Use `application/octet-stream` (or any image/binary MIME type) and target a sub-path to store binary directly on a property:

   ```http
   PUT /my-resource/33/image
   Content-Type: image/gif

   ...image data...
   ```

## Examples

**End-to-end: accept base64 JSON, store as blob, serve as binary**

```typescript
import { type RequestTargetOrId, tables, createBlob } from "harper";

export class Photo extends tables.Photo {
  // Accept base64-encoded uploads in JSON
  static async post(target: RequestTargetOrId, record: any) {
    if (record.data) {
      record.data = createBlob(
        Buffer.from(record.data, record.encoding || "base64"),
        {
          type: record.contentType || "application/octet-stream",
        },
      );
    }
    return super.post(target, record);
  }

  // Stream the blob back with the correct Content-Type
  static async get(target: RequestTargetOrId) {
    const record = await super.get(target);
    if (record?.data) {
      return {
        status: 200,
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": record.data.type || "application/octet-stream",
        },
        body: record.data,
      };
    }
    return record;
  }
}
```

## Notes

- `createBlob` takes a `Buffer` as its first argument and an options object with a `type` property for the MIME type. See [using-blob-datatype.md](using-blob-datatype.md) for full details on the blob data type.
- Always fall back to `application/octet-stream` when no MIME type is known, both when creating and when serving blobs.
- When Harper retrieves a record that has both `contentType` and `data` properties, it automatically sets the response `Content-Type` and body — no custom `get` override is required for that case unless you need additional logic.
- Non-`text` content types cause `data` to be stored and returned as a Node.js `Buffer`.
