# Harper MCP

Guidelines for exposing a Harper instance as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and for building the tools, prompts, and resources AI clients consume. Harper implements MCP Streamable HTTP (spec rev 2025-06-18) with two independent profiles: `application` (your app's surface) and `operations` (Harper administration).

## When to Use

Reference these guidelines when:

- Enabling or configuring the MCP endpoint on a Harper instance
- Connecting an MCP client (Claude, agent frameworks, custom HTTP code) to Harper
- Deciding what tools an AI should see for a schema, or trimming that surface
- Exposing custom behavior (`mcpTools`), prompt templates (`mcpPrompts`), or content (`mcpResources`) to AI clients
- Protecting a public or anonymous-accessible MCP endpoint (rate limits, durable quotas, hardening)
- Debugging MCP wire errors (session/protocol headers, 400s, SSE)

## How It Works

1. Start with `enabling-mcp` to mount a profile, then `connecting-clients` for the handshake contract.
2. For the tool surface, consult `automatic-verb-tools` first — most CRUD needs are covered with zero code — and reach for `custom-mcp-tools` only for real behavior.
3. For content and templates, use `custom-mcp-resources` and `custom-mcp-prompts`; `resources-surface` explains what exists without any code.
4. Before any public exposure, work through `security-posture`'s checklist and configure `rate-limiting` (+ `durable-quotas` for cost-bearing tools).

## Examples

See the concrete examples embedded in each rule (curl handshakes, `static mcpTools`/`mcpResources` declarations, quota-hook implementations, and hardening configs).

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category              | Impact | Prefix       |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| 1        | Setup & Connection    | HIGH   | `setup-`     |
| 2        | Tools & Prompts       | HIGH   | `tools-`     |
| 3        | Resources             | MEDIUM | `resources-` |
| 4        | Operations & Security | HIGH   | `ops-`       |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Setup & Connection (HIGH)

- `enabling-mcp` — How to enable and configure Harper's MCP server profiles (application and operations).
- `connecting-clients` — How MCP clients connect to Harper - the initialize handshake, session and protocol-version headers, and authentication.

### 2. Tools & Prompts (HIGH)

- `automatic-verb-tools` — How Harper auto-generates CRUD MCP tools from exported tables, with RBAC filtering and allow/deny/maxTools controls.
- `custom-mcp-tools` — How to expose custom instance methods as MCP tools via static mcpTools, including the anonymous-exposure security model.
- `custom-mcp-prompts` — How to publish reusable prompt templates to MCP clients via static mcpPrompts.

### 3. Resources (MEDIUM)

- `resources-surface` — The MCP resources surface - harper:// metadata URIs, harper+rest:// table descriptors, templates, subscriptions, and list_changed notifications.
- `custom-mcp-resources` — How to serve custom content (docs pages, reports, binaries) as MCP resources via static mcpResources with URI templates and completions.

### 4. Operations & Security (HIGH)

- `rate-limiting` — MCP tools/call rate limiting - per-tool, per-session, and per-client-identity token buckets, and the identityHeader trust model.
- `durable-quotas` — Operator-pluggable durable quotas for MCP tools/call via the server.setMcpQuotaHandler registration hook, with a race-safe counter pattern.
- `security-posture` — The MCP security model - anonymous access, RBAC boundaries, origin validation, audit logging, and the hardening checklist for public instances.
