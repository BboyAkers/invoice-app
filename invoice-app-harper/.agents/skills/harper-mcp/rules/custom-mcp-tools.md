# Custom MCP Tools

Instructions for the agent to follow when exposing custom instance methods as MCP tools via a static `mcpTools` array on a Resource class.

## When to Use

Apply this rule when a component needs to expose non-verb instance methods as callable MCP tools. Use it whenever you need custom business logic (e.g., reconciliation, aggregation, batch operations) accessible via the MCP transport beyond the auto-generated verb tools.

## How It Works

1. **Declare a static `mcpTools` array** on the Resource class. Each entry names the tool, maps it to an instance method, provides a description, and defines an `inputSchema`.

   ```javascript
   class Orders extends Tables.orders {
     static mcpTools = [
       {
         name: "reconcile_unsettled",
         method: "reconcileUnsettled",
         description:
           "Reconcile all orders flagged as unsettled and emit a summary",
         inputSchema: {
           type: "object",
           properties: {
             since: { type: "string", description: "ISO 8601 timestamp" },
           },
         },
       },
     ];

     async reconcileUnsettled({ since }) {
       /* ... */
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Understand the security model.** Custom tools are exposed to **every** MCP session — including `anonymous`, unauthenticated ones. The MCP layer does **not**:
   - Run an `allow*` gate automatically.
   - Open a Resource transaction automatically.
   - Filter the tool from `tools/list` based on user role.

   Unlike auto-generated verb tools (which are RBAC-filtered per user at `tools/list` time and enforce table permissions on call), a custom tool is listed to every session and its method executes even when no user is logged in. `context.user` may be empty.

3. **Enforce access control inside the method.** Because the MCP layer performs no authentication or ACL check, the method itself is fully responsible. Check `context.user` at the top of the method and throw when the caller doesn't qualify:

   ```javascript
   async reconcileUnsettled({ since }) {
     if (!context.user || !context.user.roles.includes('admin')) {
       throw new Error('Unauthorized');
     }
     /* ... */
   }
   ```

4. **Delegate to static Resource operations correctly.** The MCP-created instance context carries the authenticated user and a one-shot `authorize` flag:
   - For the **first** delegated operation, pass `this.getContext()` directly — the `authorize` flag is consumed by that call:
     ```javascript
     const result = await Orders.get(target, this.getContext());
     ```
   - For **every subsequent** delegated operation, create a fresh `RequestTarget`, set `target.checkPermission = true` so authorization derives from `context.user`, and pass `this.getContext()`:
     ```javascript
     target.checkPermission = true;
     const next = await Orders.get(target, this.getContext());
     ```
   - **Never** accept `checkPermission` from tool arguments or other client input.

## Examples

Full class with a custom MCP tool that guards access via `context.user`:

```javascript
class Orders extends Tables.orders {
  static mcpTools = [
    {
      name: "reconcile_unsettled",
      method: "reconcileUnsettled",
      description:
        "Reconcile all orders flagged as unsettled and emit a summary",
      inputSchema: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          since: { type: "string", description: "ISO 8601 timestamp" },
        },
      },
    },
  ];

  async reconcileUnsettled({ since }) {
    // Reject anonymous or unauthorized callers — the MCP layer does not do this.
    if (!context.user) {
      throw new Error("Authentication required");
    }

    // First delegated operation: use the one-shot authorize flag via this.getContext().
    const target = { since };
    const unsettled = await Orders.get(target, this.getContext());

    // Subsequent delegated operations: fresh RequestTarget with checkPermission = true.
    const updateTarget = { id: unsettled.id };
    updateTarget.checkPermission = true;
    await Orders.update(updateTarget, this.getContext());
  }
}
```

## Notes

- `mcpTools` is a **static** array — declare it on the class, not on instances.
- The `allow*` gates that protect auto-generated verb tools do **not** run for custom tools. All authorization logic must live inside the method.
- `context.user` is the canonical way to identify the caller; it may be empty for `anonymous` sessions, so always check before trusting it.
- Never derive `checkPermission` from client-supplied tool arguments — always set it explicitly in your method code.
- If your custom tool performs expensive or repeated operations, consider applying [rate limiting](rate-limiting.md) or [durable quotas](durable-quotas.md) inside the method to prevent abuse by unauthenticated callers.
