# Harper MCP

Guidelines for exposing a Harper instance as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and for building the tools, prompts, and resources AI clients consume. Harper implements MCP Streamable HTTP (spec rev 2025-06-18) with two independent profiles: `application` (your app's surface) and `operations` (Harper administration).

## 1. Setup & Connection

### 1.1 Enabling MCP

Instructions for exposing a Harper instance as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

#### When to Use

Use this skill when an AI client (Claude, an agent framework, or any MCP-capable tool) should talk to Harper directly — calling tools backed by your tables and Resources, reading data as MCP resources, or driving Harper operations.

#### How It Works

Harper ships two independent MCP **profiles**, each a Streamable HTTP endpoint (MCP spec rev 2025-06-18):

1. **`application` profile** — the profile most apps want. Exposes your application's surface: auto-generated CRUD verb tools for `@export`ed tables, plus anything components opt in via `static mcpTools` / `static mcpPrompts` / `static mcpResources`. Mounts on the application HTTP port (default `9926`).
2. **`operations` profile** — exposes Harper's operations API as tools (user-filtered by operation permissions). Mounts on the operations port (default `9925`). Intended for administrative agents, not application clients.

Enable them in `harper-config.yaml` (or the equivalent `HARPER_SET_CONFIG` process env var):

```yaml
mcp:
  application:
    mountPath: /mcp # path on the application HTTP port
  operations:
    mountPath: /mcp # path on the operations port
```

A profile is enabled by the **presence** of its config sub-block — there is no separate `enabled` flag, so `mcp: { application: {} }` alone turns the application profile on with defaults. Each profile is independent; enable only what you need. Key per-profile options:

- `mountPath` — path the endpoint mounts on (default `/mcp`).
- `allow` / `deny` (operations profile only) — glob patterns or literal operation names selecting which operations become tools. The default is a deliberately read-only list; setting `allow` **replaces** it (no merge), so destructive operations like `set_configuration` must be opted in explicitly.
- `maxTools` — page size for `tools/list` responses (default 200); overflow pages via the MCP cursor.
- `rateLimit.*` — see the [Rate Limiting](rate-limiting.md) skill.
- durable quotas — registered in code with `server.setMcpQuotaHandler`, not a config key; see the [Durable Quotas](durable-quotas.md) skill.

Version notes: the transport and tool surface shipped across 5.1.x (complete protocol surface — prompts, resources, subscriptions, completions, cancellation, progress — in 5.1.10+). Custom content resources (`mcpResources`) are 5.1.18+. Per-client rate limiting and durable quotas are 5.2.0+.

**Verify the version before relying on gated features.** Unsupported config keys (such as the `rateLimit.perClient*` security controls) are **accepted and silently ignored** by older versions — nothing errors, the feature just doesn't run. Check `serverInfo.version` in the `initialize` response (or read `harper://about`) first, and after configuring a limit, prove it denies at least once before trusting it.

#### Examples

Minimal application-profile setup for a project with `@export`ed tables:

```yaml
# harper-config.yaml
mcp:
  application:
    mountPath: /mcp
```

An MCP client pointed at `http://<host>:9926/mcp` then sees `get_*` / `search_*` / `create_*` / `update_*` / `delete_*` tools for every exported table, RBAC-filtered per authenticated user. See the [Connecting Clients](connecting-clients.md) skill for the handshake.

### 1.2 Connecting Clients

The wire-level contract an MCP client (or your own HTTP code) must follow against a Harper MCP endpoint.

#### When to Use

Use this skill when configuring an MCP client against Harper, writing integration tests that drive `/mcp` directly, or debugging 400/404 responses from the endpoint.

#### How It Works

Harper implements MCP **Streamable HTTP** (spec rev 2025-06-18; rev 2025-03-26 also accepted):

1. **Initialize.** POST a JSON-RPC `initialize` to the mount path with `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream`. The response carries the negotiated `protocolVersion`, the server's capabilities, and — critically — an `Mcp-Session-Id` response header.
2. **Session header.** Every subsequent request MUST send that `Mcp-Session-Id` back. Missing/unknown ids get 400/404 (a 404 means re-initialize — sessions idle out after `mcp.session.idleTimeoutSeconds`, default 30 minutes).
3. **Protocol-version header.** Requests after initialize should send `MCP-Protocol-Version: <negotiated version>`. A header naming a _different_ supported version than the session negotiated is rejected (400). A **missing** header is accepted as the session's own negotiated version (5.2.0+, patched into 5.1.x; older 5.1 releases treated a missing header as `2025-03-26` and rejected it as a mismatch on `2025-06-18` sessions).
4. **Server-push SSE.** A GET on the mount path (with `Accept: text/event-stream`) opens the server→client stream used for `notifications/*/list_changed`, resource-update notifications, progress, and server-initiated requests. Some flows require it: `resources/subscribe` is rejected until the session has an open SSE stream.
5. **Authentication.** Standard Harper authentication applies (Basic auth, tokens, mTLS — whatever the instance is configured with). Anonymous sessions are accepted when the deployment allows them; see the [Security Posture](security-posture.md) skill for what anonymous callers can reach.

#### Examples

Full curl handshake:

```bash
# 1. initialize — capture the session id from the response headers
curl -si http://localhost:9926/mcp \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -u admin:password \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{
        "protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{},
        "clientInfo":{"name":"my-client","version":"1.0"}}}'
# → 200, header: Mcp-Session-Id: <uuid>

# 2. subsequent calls carry the session + protocol headers
curl -s http://localhost:9926/mcp \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -H 'mcp-session-id: <uuid>' \
  -H 'mcp-protocol-version: 2025-06-18' \
  -u admin:password \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
```

Claude Desktop / MCP-client configuration is just the URL (plus auth): point a Streamable HTTP transport at `http://<host>:9926/mcp`.

Debugging cheat sheet:

- `400 missing Mcp-Session-Id header` — you skipped step 2.
- `404` on a previously working session — idle timeout; re-initialize.
- `400 MCP-Protocol-Version mismatch` — you sent a header naming a different version than the session negotiated.
- `406` — missing the required `Accept` media type (JSON for POST, `text/event-stream` for GET).
- `403 origin_not_allowed` — browser-origin request rejected by CORS-tied origin validation; see [Security Posture](security-posture.md).

## 2. Tools & Prompts

### 2.1 Automatic Verb Tools

The zero-code tool surface: every `@export`ed table becomes a family of CRUD tools on the application profile.

#### When to Use

Use this skill when deciding what an MCP client will see for a given schema, when tools are unexpectedly missing from `tools/list`, or when trimming a large generated surface.

#### How It Works

1. **Generation.** For each exported table `Widget`, the application profile registers `get_Widget`, `search_Widget`, `create_Widget`, `update_Widget`, and `delete_Widget` tools. Names preserve the Resource path's case (`/` and `.` become `_`, other non-identifier characters are dropped); path collisions get a deterministic database-name prefix. Input/output schemas are derived from the table's typed attributes, so clients get real parameter validation and result shapes.
2. **RBAC is enforced, twice.** `tools/list` is filtered per authenticated user (a user with no read permission on a table does not see its `get_`/`search_` tools), and calls run through the same permission enforcement as REST — including per-record `allow*` predicates on Resource subclasses. This is the key contrast with [custom tools](custom-mcp-tools.md), which are visible to everyone.
3. **`exportTypes` gating.** A Resource registered with `exportTypes: { mcp: false }` is excluded from MCP enumeration entirely, independent of its REST exposure.
4. **Surface controls.** On the application profile, trim per Resource with `exportTypes: { mcp: false }`; `maxTools` sets the `tools/list` page size (default 200, cursor pages overflow). The `allow`/`deny` glob filters belong to the **operations** profile's tool generation, not this one. Prefer trimming to what the AI actually needs — every tool costs client context.
5. **Live registration (5.1.18+).** The tool registry rebuilds lazily when the underlying Resource registry changes (schema changes, deploys, components that finish loading after boot), so tools stay in sync without restarts; connected sessions receive `notifications/tools/list_changed` when their visible set actually changes. On earlier 5.1.x, registration depends on schema-creation events — a restart on an existing data root can come up with an **empty custom-tool registry** (the tables already exist, so no event fires); upgrading is the fix.
6. **Plain `Resource` classes get partial tool families.** An exported non-table `Resource` subclass surfaces verb tools only for the REST verbs it actually has (typically a lone `create_*` from the base `post`). To host `mcpTools`/`mcpResources` without any verb surface, register the class via `server.resources.set(name, Class, { mcp: false })`-style exportTypes at registration — note a `static exportTypes` field on the class is NOT read.

#### Examples

```graphql
# schema.graphql
type Widget @table @export {
  id: ID @primaryKey
  name: String @indexed
  price: Float
}
```

With `mcp.application.mountPath` set, `tools/list` (as a user with read/write on Widget) includes:

```json
{ "name": "search_Widget", "inputSchema": { "properties": { "conditions": { "...": "..." } } } }
{ "name": "get_Widget", "inputSchema": { "properties": { "id": { "type": "string" } } } }
{ "name": "create_Widget", "...": "..." }
```

Excluding an exported Resource from MCP while keeping its REST surface — set the `mcp` exportType at registration (a `static exportTypes` field on the class is NOT read):

```javascript
server.resources.set("internal-thing", InternalThing, { mcp: false });
```

To expose read-only _data_, rely on RBAC: a role without write permissions never sees `create_`/`update_`/`delete_` tools for the table.

### 2.2 Custom MCP Tools

Instructions for the agent to follow when exposing custom instance methods as MCP tools via a static `mcpTools` array on a Resource class.

#### When to Use

Apply this rule when a component needs to expose non-verb instance methods as callable MCP tools. Use it whenever you need custom business logic (e.g., reconciliation, aggregation, batch operations) accessible via the MCP transport beyond the auto-generated verb tools.

#### How It Works

1. **Declare a static `mcpTools` array** on the Resource class. Each entry names the tool, maps it to an instance method, provides a description, and defines an `inputSchema`.

   ```javascript
   class Orders extends Tables.orders {
     static mcpTools = [
       {
         name: "reconcile_unsettled",
         method: "reconcileUnsettled",
         description:
           "Reconcile all orders flagged as unsettled and emit a summary",
         inputSchema: {
           type: "object",
           properties: {
             since: { type: "string", description: "ISO 8601 timestamp" },
           },
         },
       },
     ];

     async reconcileUnsettled({ since }) {
       /* ... */
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Understand the security model.** Custom tools are exposed to **every** MCP session — including `anonymous`, unauthenticated ones. The MCP layer does **not**:
   - Run an `allow*` gate automatically.
   - Open a Resource transaction automatically.
   - Filter the tool from `tools/list` based on user role.

   Unlike auto-generated verb tools (which are RBAC-filtered per user at `tools/list` time and enforce table permissions on call), a custom tool is listed to every session and its method executes even when no user is logged in. `context.user` may be empty.

3. **Enforce access control inside the method.** Because the MCP layer performs no authentication or ACL check, the method itself is fully responsible. Check `context.user` at the top of the method and throw when the caller doesn't qualify:

   ```javascript
   async reconcileUnsettled({ since }) {
     if (!context.user || !context.user.roles.includes('admin')) {
       throw new Error('Unauthorized');
     }
     /* ... */
   }
   ```

4. **Delegate to static Resource operations correctly.** The MCP-created instance context carries the authenticated user and a one-shot `authorize` flag:
   - For the **first** delegated operation, pass `this.getContext()` directly — the `authorize` flag is consumed by that call:
     ```javascript
     const result = await Orders.get(target, this.getContext());
     ```
   - For **every subsequent** delegated operation, create a fresh `RequestTarget`, set `target.checkPermission = true` so authorization derives from `context.user`, and pass `this.getContext()`:
     ```javascript
     target.checkPermission = true;
     const next = await Orders.get(target, this.getContext());
     ```
   - **Never** accept `checkPermission` from tool arguments or other client input.

#### Examples

Full class with a custom MCP tool that guards access via `context.user`:

```javascript
class Orders extends Tables.orders {
  static mcpTools = [
    {
      name: "reconcile_unsettled",
      method: "reconcileUnsettled",
      description:
        "Reconcile all orders flagged as unsettled and emit a summary",
      inputSchema: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          since: { type: "string", description: "ISO 8601 timestamp" },
        },
      },
    },
  ];

  async reconcileUnsettled({ since }) {
    // Reject anonymous or unauthorized callers — the MCP layer does not do this.
    if (!context.user) {
      throw new Error("Authentication required");
    }

    // First delegated operation: use the one-shot authorize flag via this.getContext().
    const target = { since };
    const unsettled = await Orders.get(target, this.getContext());

    // Subsequent delegated operations: fresh RequestTarget with checkPermission = true.
    const updateTarget = { id: unsettled.id };
    updateTarget.checkPermission = true;
    await Orders.update(updateTarget, this.getContext());
  }
}
```

#### Notes

- `mcpTools` is a **static** array — declare it on the class, not on instances.
- The `allow*` gates that protect auto-generated verb tools do **not** run for custom tools. All authorization logic must live inside the method.
- `context.user` is the canonical way to identify the caller; it may be empty for `anonymous` sessions, so always check before trusting it.
- Never derive `checkPermission` from client-supplied tool arguments — always set it explicitly in your method code.
- If your custom tool performs expensive or repeated operations, consider applying [rate limiting](rate-limiting.md) or [durable quotas](durable-quotas.md) inside the method to prevent abuse by unauthenticated callers.

### 2.3 Custom MCP Prompts

Publish parameterized prompt templates that MCP clients surface to their users (slash-command style).

#### When to Use

Use this skill when your application wants to hand well-crafted, data-aware prompts to any connected AI client — "summarize this account", "draft a reply about order X" — instead of hoping each client writes a good one.

#### How It Works

1. **Declare `static mcpPrompts`** on a Resource class. Each entry carries a `render` **function** (not a method name):

```javascript
export class Support extends tables.Ticket {
  static mcpPrompts = [
    {
      name: "draft_reply",
      title: "Draft support reply",
      description: "Draft a support reply for a ticket",
      arguments: [
        { name: "ticketId", description: "Ticket to reply to", required: true },
      ],
      async render(args) {
        const ticket = await Support.get(args.ticketId);
        if (!ticket) throw new Error(`ticket not found: ${args.ticketId}`);
        return {
          messages: [
            {
              role: "user",
              content: {
                type: "text",
                text: `Draft a courteous reply to: ${ticket.body}`,
              },
            },
          ],
        };
      },
    },
  ];
}
```

2. **Entry shape.** `name` and `render` are required (invalid entries are skipped with a warning); `title`, `description`, and `arguments` (`{ name, description?, required? }`) are optional metadata surfaced to clients.
3. **Render contract.** `render(args)` receives the client-supplied argument values (strings) and returns the MCP prompt result shape — a `messages` array of `{ role, content }` entries (`content.type`: `text`, `image`, `audio`, or `resource`). It runs server-side and can read tables, so prompts can embed live data.
4. **Surface.** Prompts appear in `prompts/list` and render via `prompts/get`; declared arguments are served through `completion/complete`. Connected sessions get `notifications/prompts/list_changed` when the set changes (reload/deploy).
5. **Exposure.** Like custom tools, prompts are listed to every session on the profile, including anonymous ones — keep secrets out of prompt text and gate inside `render` if needed.

#### Examples

A data-aware prompt beats a static template: fetch current state (ticket, order, account) inside the render method so the client's LLM starts from live facts rather than asking for them turn by turn.

## 3. Resources

### 3.1 Resources Surface

What `resources/list`, `resources/read`, `resources/templates/list`, and `resources/subscribe` expose from a Harper instance.

#### When to Use

Use this skill when an MCP client should _read_ from Harper (schemas, API descriptions, data descriptors) rather than call tools, or when wiring change notifications.

#### How It Works

Three URI families appear on the application profile:

1. **`harper://` metadata resources** (no HTTP equivalent):
   - `harper://about` — server version, profile, protocol versions, capabilities (both profiles).
   - `harper://schema/{database}/{table}` — per-table attribute definitions, RBAC-filtered at read time (also offered as a URI template).
   - `harper://openapi` — the OpenAPI 3.0.3 document for the REST surface.
   - `harper://operations` — operations profile only; the caller's allowed operation names.
2. **`harper+rest://<host>:<port>/<path>` descriptors** — one per exported Resource passing the `exportTypes.mcp` gate. Reading one returns a small JSON descriptor (path, database, table, and a hint to use the corresponding verb tools for records) — it is a pointer, not a data dump. The scheme is `harper+rest` (5.1.18+) because the MCP spec reserves `https://` for resources a client can fetch from the web; legacy `http(s)://` URIs from older listings still read and subscribe.
3. **Author-defined custom resources** — arbitrary URIs/templates served by component code; see the [Custom MCP Resources](custom-mcp-resources.md) skill. Custom URIs take precedence over the discovered surfaces on `resources/read`.

Other behaviors:

- **Subscriptions.** Row-backed application resources support `resources/subscribe` (change notifications delivered on the SSE stream). The session must have its GET SSE stream open first — subscribe calls before that are rejected with an instructive error. Subscriptions are restored on session resume.
- **`notifications/resources/list_changed`.** Sessions are notified when their _visible_ resource set (including templates) actually changes — per-session diffing keeps no-op rebuilds silent.
- **Pagination.** All list endpoints use opaque cursors per the MCP spec; treat `nextCursor` as a black box.

#### Examples

Reading a table's schema as an AI-consumable resource:

```json
→ {"method":"resources/read","params":{"uri":"harper://schema/data/widget"}}
← {"result":{"contents":[{"uri":"harper://schema/data/widget","mimeType":"application/json",
    "text":"{\"attributes\":[{\"name\":\"id\",\"type\":\"ID\"},...]}"}]}}
```

Point a client at `harper://openapi` when it needs the whole REST contract in one read.

### 3.2 Custom MCP Resources

Serve author-defined content — documentation pages, rendered reports, binary assets — under your own URIs (5.1.18+).

#### When to Use

Use this skill to build a content surface for AI clients: a public docs server over MCP, per-entity report resources, or any read-oriented content the auto-generated descriptors can't express.

#### How It Works

1. **Declare `static mcpResources`** on a Resource class. Each entry has exactly one of `uri` (fixed) or `uriTemplate`, plus a `method` naming the instance method that serves reads:

```javascript
export class DocsPages extends Resource {
  static mcpResources = [
    {
      uri: "docs:///index",
      name: "docs index",
      description: "List of all documentation pages",
      mimeType: "text/markdown",
      method: "readIndex",
    },
    {
      uriTemplate: "docs:///{+path}",
      name: "docs page",
      mimeType: "text/markdown",
      method: "readPage",
      completions: { path: ["guides/install.md", "guides/deploy.md"] },
    },
  ];

  async readIndex() {
    return {
      text: "- docs:///guides/install.md\n…",
      mimeType: "text/markdown",
    };
  }

  async readPage(
    params /* { path } */,
    context /* { user, profile, sessionId } */,
  ) {
    // {+path} spans segments BY DESIGN (it can contain `/` and `..`), so never
    // hand it to filesystem path construction unvalidated. A keyed lookup like
    // this is inherently safe; if you must touch the filesystem, resolve and
    // verify containment first.
    const page = PAGES.get(params.path);
    if (!page) throw new Error(`no such page: ${params.path}`);
    return { text: page, mimeType: "text/markdown" };
  }
}
```

2. **Templates.** `{name}` matches exactly one path segment; `{+name}` matches across segments (RFC-6570-style reserved expansion — how MCP clients expand templates). The single-segment contract is enforced through percent-decoding: a URI smuggling an encoded separator (`%2F`/`%5C`) into a `{name}` slot simply fails to match, so `{name}` is safe to use in path construction. Duplicate parameter names are rejected at registration.
3. **Schemes.** Pick a custom scheme (`docs:///…` above). The reserved schemes — `harper:`, `harper+rest:`, `http:`, `https:` — are rejected at registration (and a template cannot parameterize the scheme position), so custom entries can never shadow the built-in surfaces.
4. **Content shapes.** The read method returns a string (text), `{ text, mimeType? }`, `{ blob, mimeType? }` (base64 binary), or any other object (serialized as JSON). Read errors surface to the client as a sanitized JSON-RPC error; the raw error goes to the server log only.
5. **Listing and completion.** Fixed URIs appear in `resources/list`, templates in `resources/templates/list`; declared `completions` values serve `completion/complete` per template parameter. Custom URIs win over the discovered surfaces on `resources/read`.
6. **Anonymous by design.** Custom resources are served to any session — including unauthenticated ones (the public-docs case this feature targets). The MCP layer performs no auth check for them; gate inside the read method (`context.user`) if content is restricted.
7. **No tables required.** A tableless component's resources register reliably — the registry rebuilds lazily per request when component loading completes after boot.

#### Examples

Public docs server: the two-entry declaration above plus `mcp.application.mountPath` is the whole server — clients browse `resources/list`, complete paths, and read pages, all anonymous. Pair with [Rate Limiting](rate-limiting.md) and [Durable Quotas](durable-quotas.md) if any companion tools bear cost.

## 4. Operations & Security

### 4.1 Rate Limiting

In-memory token buckets that bound `tools/call` throughput per profile.

#### When to Use

Use this skill when tuning MCP throughput, and **always** when a tool is exposed on a public or anonymous-accessible instance — the default limits alone do not stop session-cycling abuse.

#### How It Works

Four session-scoped limits ship with sensible defaults (per profile, configurable under `mcp.<profile>.rateLimit.*`):

- `perToolPerSecond` / `perToolBurst` — sustained rate and burst per (session, tool).
- `sessionConcurrency` — max in-flight calls per session.
- `sessionPerSecond` — sustained rate per session across all tools.

Limit hits return an `isError` tool result with `kind: 'rate_limited'` and a `scope` field (not a JSON-RPC error), so the calling LLM can see and back off.

**Session buckets are evadable by anonymous clients**: `initialize → call → drop session → repeat` gets fresh buckets every loop. Two additions close that (5.2.0+):

- `perClientPerSecond` / `perClientBurst` (default off) — a bucket keyed on **client identity** rather than session, surviving the cycling loop. Burst defaults to the sustained rate, floored at one whole token (a fractional rate like `0.1` = "6/minute" still admits its first call). Denials report `scope: 'per_client'`.
- `identityHeader` — identity defaults to the client socket IP; deployments behind a reverse proxy can name a trusted header (typically `x-forwarded-for`, first value wins). **Only set this when the proxy strips or replaces the header on untrusted traffic** — a client-controlled identity header lets callers mint fresh identities per request and bypass the limit; Harper logs a startup warning when it is configured.

All bucket state is in-memory per worker: it resets on restart and is not shared across workers. For durable, restart-surviving limits, see the [Durable Quotas](durable-quotas.md) skill.

On Harper versions before 5.2.0 the `perClient*`/`identityHeader` keys are **accepted and silently ignored** — verify `serverInfo.version` and prove a denial once before trusting the limit (see [Enabling MCP](enabling-mcp.md)).

#### Examples

Public docs server with a cost-bearing `answer` tool — bound instantaneous abuse:

```yaml
mcp:
  application:
    mountPath: /mcp
    rateLimit:
      perClientPerSecond: 0.5 # 30/minute sustained per client
      perClientBurst: 5
```

Behind a proxy that manages `X-Forwarded-For` correctly:

```yaml
mcp:
  application:
    rateLimit:
      identityHeader: x-forwarded-for
      perClientPerSecond: 0.5
```

### 4.2 Durable Quotas

Persisted, restart-surviving cost controls for `tools/call`, registered as a plain function in your component code (5.2.0+).

#### When to Use

Use this skill when in-memory [rate limiting](rate-limiting.md) is not enough as a cost control — typically a public, unauthenticated, cost-bearing tool (an LLM-backed `answer`) where you need "N calls per identity per day" semantics that survive restarts and span workers.

#### How It Works

1. **Register a handler function** with `server.setMcpQuotaHandler` at component load — the policy is a **function**, never an exposed Resource. It is opt-in: no handler registered means calls are allowed. The latest registration wins, so a reloaded component replaces the previous handler; pass `undefined` to clear it.
2. **The handler is called before each admitted `tools/call`** with `{ identity, tool, user, profile, sessionId }` (`identity` is the client identity from the rate-limit layer — socket IP or trusted-header value — and may be `undefined`). Return `true` (or any truthy non-object) to allow, or `{ allowed: false, message?, retryAfterSeconds? }` to deny; denials surface as `isError` tool results with `kind: 'quota_exceeded'` plus your `message`/`retryAfterSeconds`.
3. **Gate per profile in code.** The single handler receives `profile`, so branch on it (e.g. `if (profile !== 'application') return true`) rather than configuring per-profile hooks.
4. **Ordering.** The handler runs _after_ the in-memory buckets admit the call, so rate-limited clients cannot spam a table-backed handler.
5. **Fail-closed.** A handler that throws **denies** the call — the raw error goes to the server log only; the client sees a sanitized message. Cost protection that silently disables itself on a bug is worse than a hard failure. Harper calls the handler once per attempted tool call; whether you count on check or on success is your business.
6. **Race-safety is your handler's business.** It can run concurrently for the same identity — within a worker (interleavings across your own `await`s) and across workers. A naive `get` → `put used+1` counter undercounts under concurrency and admits calls past the limit; make the read-modify-write atomic (a transaction that serializes conflicting writers, a compare-and-set retry loop, or a store with native atomic increments).

#### Examples

Persisted per-identity counter backed by an **internal** table (schema + registration):

```graphql
# schema.graphql — INTERNAL counter. No @export, so no client can read or reset it.
type QuotaCounter @table {
  id: ID @primaryKey
  used: Int
}
```

```javascript
// resources.js
const DAILY_LIMIT = 100;

// The cost-bearing tool clients call (exported — this is the public surface).
export class Answerer extends Resource {
  static mcpTools = [
    { name: "answer", description: "Answer a question", method: "doAnswer" },
  ];
  async doAnswer(args) {
    return { answered: args?.q ?? "" };
  }
}

// Register the durable quota policy as a function, backed by the internal counter table.
server.setMcpQuotaHandler(
  async ({ identity, tool, user, profile, sessionId }) => {
    if (profile !== "application") return true; // gate per profile in code
    const id = identity ?? "unknown";
    // NOTE: naive get-then-put shown for shape; production code must make this
    // read-modify-write atomic (see Race-safety above).
    const existing = await tables.QuotaCounter.get(id);
    const used = (existing?.used ?? 0) + 1;
    await tables.QuotaCounter.put({ id, used });
    if (used > DAILY_LIMIT) {
      return {
        allowed: false,
        message: "daily quota reached",
        retryAfterSeconds: 3600,
      };
    }
    return true;
  },
);
```

Because the policy is a plain function and not a Resource, it exposes no `update_/delete_` MCP tools or REST surface — unlike an exported class, whose inherited CRUD would let a permitted client reset its own counter. Keep the storage table **unexported** (no `@export`) so it stays off every transport.

Also verify the handler actually runs (call the tool past the limit once): on Harper versions before 5.2.0 `server.setMcpQuotaHandler` is unavailable — see [Enabling MCP](enabling-mcp.md).

### 4.3 Security Posture

What is and is not protected on a Harper MCP endpoint, and the checklist for exposing one publicly.

#### When to Use

Read this skill before exposing any MCP profile beyond localhost, and when reasoning about what an anonymous or low-privilege caller can reach.

#### How It Works

1. **Authentication is Harper's, not MCP's.** The MCP layer adds no login gate. Sessions bind to whatever user Harper's auth pipeline resolves — which can be nobody: anonymous sessions initialize, list, and call successfully where the deployment allows unauthenticated requests.
2. **Two different tool trust models.** Auto-generated verb tools are RBAC-filtered per user and enforce table permissions (including per-record `allow*` predicates) on every call. Custom `mcpTools` / `mcpPrompts` / `mcpResources` are exposed to **every** session — access control is entirely the author's method's responsibility. Never assume a custom tool is login-gated.
3. **Origin validation (DNS-rebinding defense).** Browser-origin requests are validated against Harper's CORS configuration; a disallowed `Origin` gets 403. The secure default for anything browser-reachable beyond loopback: enable CORS with an explicit allow-list (`http.cors` + `http.corsAccessList` for the application profile; `operationsApi.network.*` for operations). CORS off means origin checks are off — appropriate only for localhost/non-browser clients.
4. **Error hygiene.** Tool and resource errors cross the wire as sanitized messages; stack traces and raw author errors stay in the server log.
5. **Audit.** Every `tools/call` (including rate-limited, quota-denied, and protocol-error outcomes) emits an audit entry — profile, session, tool, user, duration, status, with sensitive-looking argument keys redacted.
6. **Template safety.** Custom resource URI templates enforce their single-segment contract against encoded-separator smuggling, and custom URIs cannot claim reserved schemes — see [Custom MCP Resources](custom-mcp-resources.md).

#### Examples

Hardening checklist for a public application-profile endpoint:

- [ ] Every custom tool/prompt/resource either tolerates anonymous callers or checks `context.user` and throws.
- [ ] `rateLimit.perClientPerSecond` set (session limits alone are cycle-evadable); `identityHeader` only if the proxy strips it.
- [ ] A durable `quota` hook backs any cost-bearing tool ([Durable Quotas](durable-quotas.md)), with an atomic counter.
- [ ] CORS allow-list configured if browsers will reach the endpoint.
- [ ] The tool surface is trimmed to what the AI needs: `exportTypes: { mcp: false }` on internal Resources (application), a deliberate `allow` list (operations — remember it replaces the read-only default).
- [ ] Audit log shipping somewhere you actually read.
- [ ] Version verified (`serverInfo.version` ≥ the feature gates you rely on) and each protection **proven to deny once** — older versions accept and silently ignore `rateLimit.perClient*` / `quota.*` keys.
- [ ] The quota hook's table is not itself exposed — register it via `server.resources.set('McpQuota', McpQuota, { mcp: false, rest: false })` instead of module-exporting it (a `static exportTypes` field is not read); otherwise clients can reset their own counters.
